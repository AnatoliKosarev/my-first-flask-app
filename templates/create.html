<h1>Create post</h1>
<form method="POST">
  <!-- The action is what route to send data to; the method is how to send the data.
	     using GET sends data as query string parameters; using POST sends it hidden inside the form payload.
	     The action has now been removed, and then it defaults to "this page".
		 Since we're loading the form AND receiving the data on the same route,
		 we don't need to specify the `action="/posts/create"` anymore.
		 POST method will be used after user submits the form, so we know it contains data
		 GET will be used when user navigates to the form page before he inputs anything in it-->
